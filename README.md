# C2 Wiki in Remix

I was having problems reading content from the [c2 wiki](https://wiki.c2.com) on my phone
as they use some browser features not available there.

This project reaches out to the c2 wiki with whatever slug you give it and tries to render a
simple HTML view from it. It solves my immediate pain point and is unlikely to evolve at all.
